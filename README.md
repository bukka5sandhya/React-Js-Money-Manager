Initially, the value of the amountInput should be empty

Initially, the first option in the list should be selected

When a transaction is added, by providing the values in the titleInput, amountInput and optionId and Add button is clicked,

A new transaction should be added to the transaction history list

totalBalance, totalIncome and totalExpenses should be updated accordingly

totalBalance = totalIncome - totalExpenses

After updating, the values in the titleInput,amountInput and optionId will be updated to their initial values

Things to Keep in Mind

All components you implement should go in the src/components directory.

Don't change the component folder names as those are the files being imported into the tests.

Do not remove the pre-filled code
